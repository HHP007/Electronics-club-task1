# Magnetic Polarity Detector using Hall effect sensor 

## Description
This project is aimed to detect the North Pole and South Pole of a magnet, whether it is neodymium magnet, ring magnet or disc magnet. 
Though we know that opposite poles of a magnet attract and same poles repel, it is hard to say that which one is south pole and which one is a north pole.

We build a Magnetic Polarity Detector using the Hall Sensor and LEDs. 
To detect the North Pole and the South Pole , we use two Hall Effect sensors and these sensors are connected in the opposite direction. One sensor detects the North Pole and another Sensor detects the South Pole. 
Two LEDs are used to indicate the North Pole and the South Pole of a magnet. 

Components Required

    A3144 Hall-effect Sensor (2)
    LED (2)
    7805 Voltage Regulator
    Capacitor (0.1µf & 10µf)
    10k Resistor (2)
    Jumper Wires
    Breadboard


Hall Effect sensor is a small-scale microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device for detecting and measuring magnetic fields.

These sensors can detect changes in a magnetic field like flux, strength, and direction. 
When the magnetic flux density around the sensor changes due to the magnet, the sensor detects it and generates an output voltage, and due to this output voltage LED connected to the Magnet sensor changes its state from low to high. 
In this project, we are using the Hall Effect sensors to detect the North Pole and the South Pole of a magnet. The circuit is as follows :

## Description
After connecting the circuit, as shown in the above image, power the setup using a 9V battery. Initially, LEDs will be in High state. Now bring a magnet closer to the Magnet sensors, if you bring south pole near to Red LED, it will turn off. And if you bring North pole near to Green LED indicates it becomes off.
