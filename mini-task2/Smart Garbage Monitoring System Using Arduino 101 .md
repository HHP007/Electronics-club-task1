# Smart Garbage Monitoring System Using Arduino 101 

## Description
Solid waste management has been a major concern for the environment which impacts the health and environment of our society. 
The detection, monitoring, and management of wastes are one of the primary problems of the present era. 
This is an IoT Garbage Monitoring system, that will help to keep the cities clean and healthy. This system gives a real-time indicator of the garbage level in a trashcan at any given time. 

Using that data we can then optimize waste collection routes and ultimately reduce fuel consumption. It allows trash collectors to plan their daily/weekly pick up schedule. An ultrasonic sensor will be placed on the interior side of the lid, the one facing the solid waste.
As trash increases, the distance between the ultrasonic and the trash decreases. This live data will be sent to the microcontroller, the Arduino 101 then processes the data and through the help of WiFi(the Wi-fi module used here is Arduino MKR100) sends it to an app. 
There is an app that visually represents the amount of trash in the bin with a small animation. To connect to the internet we use a prebuilt platform called Blynk, which can be downloaded from the android play store for free.

## Base shield for Arduino
It is sometimes frustrating when your project requires a lot of sensors or LEDs and your jumper wires are in a mess. The purpose of creating the Base Shield is to help you get rid of breadboard and jumper wires. 
With the rich grove connectors on the baseboard, you can add all the grove modules to the Arduino Uno conveniently! The pinout of Base Shield V2 is the same as Arduino Uno R3.
