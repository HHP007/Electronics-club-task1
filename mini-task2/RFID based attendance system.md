# RFID based attendance system

__Description:__
This project is aimed in using RFID technology take attendance automatically. An LCD displayand a dadabase is attached with a microcontroller, which is connected to a RFID reader. All the students are given unique RFID tags. Users must place the RFID tag in front of the RFID reader, when entering a room. If the tag is present in the database, the concerned student is marked present. If a tag is placed whose number does not exist in the database, the LCD displays a message that the user is unauthorised.

Microcontroller is the important unit of the project. It receives and manipulates data and excute of the tasks. Microcontrollers like AVR(ATmega 8) and 8051 can be used for this project. Also, they can be coded using a programming board.
