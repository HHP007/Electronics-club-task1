# Contactless hand wash timer

## Description
Regular hand washing and use of sanitizer is the only way to remove the corona viruses from our hand.
This project is used for washing hands for a minimum of 20 secs which is really necessary to prevent the spread of the virus. 
But to ensure the time, we use a servo motor which takes 20 seconds to turn by 180 degrees and stop the flow of water when the motor has turned by 180 degrees.
An Arduino is used to control the motion of the motor. Distance sensor is use to detect the presence of hand and if the hand is present, then the motor begins to rotate as mentioned before.
